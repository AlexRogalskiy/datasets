# Public datasets

These datasets are gathered together for testing out your Algolia account. To use them there are two options.

## Dashboard

In the Algolia dashboard, you can upload one of theses JSON files without any setup.

## Via code

A JSON file can be loaded with a programming language of your choice, and then for performance it should be batched and be added to a index.

More information can be found in [this guide](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/indexing/import-synchronize-data/) on the Algolia documentation.
